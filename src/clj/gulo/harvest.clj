  "Functions for harvesting Darwin Core Archives from IPT.

  A Darwin Core Archive (archive) is a zip file that contains a Darwin
  Core record dataset with an EML metadata document. The metadata
  describes what the dataset is and when it was last updated.

  Archives are published online by the Integrated Publishing
  Toolkit (IPT) as resources. Each resource has an RSS feed that
  describes the resource, when it was last published, and provides
  download links to the archive.

  For convienience, we store resource URLs that we want to harvest in
  CartoDB:

    https://vertnet.cartodb.com/tables/resource

  When we harvest resources, we extract the dataset and metadata from
  their archive, lookup the resource organization if possible, and
  encode everything (records, resource, dataset, organization) into a
  simple CSV textline that gets uploaded to S3.

The main collection contains over 480,000 specimens, including 600 holotypes, 70,000 skeletons, and 7,000 fluid specimens. In addition, the division houses 21,000 egg sets and 200 nests. The scope of the collection is world-wide; all bird families but one are represented, as are 90% of the world's genera and species. Included among its many historically and scientifically valuable individual collections are the H. B. Conover Game Bird Collection, Good's and Van Someren's African collections, C. B. Cory's West Indian collection, the Bishop Collection of North American birds, a large portion of W.
